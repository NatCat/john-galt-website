  heading: Partner Group "John Galt"
  paragraphs:
    - Our group unites several organizations and teams engaged in the production
      of technological equipment and industrial automation systems for the food
      industry, welding and electrical installation services, real-time software
      development, as well as sourcing and importing technological components.
    - >-
      As a group of companies and technical crews operating across multiple
      countries, we work with a wide range of clients — from large vertically
      integrated industrial corporations to individual customers with specific
      technical needs. Our contactable technical representatives are located in
      regions including the Balkans, the South Caucasus and Iran, China, India,
      and CIS countries.
  capabilities:
    - Manufacturing of mixing and filtration equipment for the alcoholic
      beverage industry (including the continuous blending and treatment
      technology known as “Ruchey”), as well as the development of comprehensive
      solutions for vodka and spirits production lines using both traditional
      and simplified methods;
    - Production, maintenance, and servicing of proprietary and third-party
      industrial and municipal water purification systems based on reverse
      osmosis, microfiltration, and ion exchange technologies — including for
      food and pharmaceutical enterprises, boiler rooms, and water intake
      stations;
    - Supply and maintenance of low-capacity water treatment systems for small
      and medium-sized businesses (restaurants, hotels, private homes), as well
      as for residential infrastructure;
    - Technological installation and commissioning services at enterprises with
      continuous production cycles (e.g. food, alcohol, chemical, and fuel
      industries), particularly where stainless-steel tank and piping systems
      are used;
    - Custom and small-batch production of low-voltage and power control cabinet
      equipment — based on schematic documentation, technical specifications, or
      open client requirements. This includes component supply, cabinet software
      development (softlogic, microSCADA), and preparation of technical
      documentation;
    - Installation of distributed soil, hydrological, and meteorological
      monitoring stations for agriculture, aquaculture, and municipal
      applications;
    - Supply of components and ready-to-use modules for scalable energy storage
      systems (e.g. redox systems);
    - Development of bespoke software for automated process control and
      operational/production management systems (SCADA, MRPI, MRPII).

          It began at the turn of the millennium and, in many ways, resembles
          the path taken by most engineering companies:


          1998–2002 – An outsourced I&C (Instrumentation and Control) team began work at the Kristall Moscow Distillery, focusing on both day-to-day maintenance of instrumentation systems and long-term projects in process automation. During this time, the team developed the first automated alcohol accounting system in Russia, streamlining the distillery’s interactions with tax authorities.


          2003–2004 – At the request of Kristall and several other enterprises, the team began developing equipment for continuous vodka blending. Initially, they considered German mixing units and the legacy “Poltavchanka” unit developed in the former Ukrainian SSR. However, they soon realized that copying outdated, imprecise, and non-standardized systems was futile. Instead, the team created their own technical solution, which later became known as the “Ruchey” technology (literally “stream”). The method was formally approved as a national industry standard.


          Unlike its predecessors, the new line was not only capable of fully automated preparation of water-alcohol mixtures (called sortirovka), but also integrated other vodka production operations: instant thermal stabilization, filtration, and ingredient dosing. The system significantly improved product quality and productivity, attracting the first clients.


          After assembling pilot units, the production of these lines was transferred to a design team with extensive experience in industrial water purification systems. From the 1970s to 1990s, these specialists worked in Vladimir (Russia) on micro- and nanofiltration technologies, and before that – on isotope separation plants for military use.


          At the same time, the engineering team at Kristall – operating under the name “Komens” – gained significant expertise in developing precision alcohol metering systems. They were invited by Russia’s Ministry of Agriculture to help create pilot standards for the national alcohol tracking system. These developments later formed the foundation of the EGAIS (Unified State Automated Information System) and were also used in the “Bakus” brand, widely known across the CIS.


          The Komens company also continued its original work: manufacturing portable kits for monitoring turbine generators, which was its initial purpose.


          By the late 2000s, the focus areas of alcohol metering and mixing-line development were split. The Komens Group remained dedicated to metering systems and began distributing Endress+Hauser flowmeters (many of the team were former employees of this company).


          Meanwhile, the development of industrial process control systems and the manufacturing of blending equipment were transferred to a new company: RTS Automatizatsiya.


          Founded in March 2010, RTS Automatizatsiya became the principal developer of automated control systems for blending lines under the new names ALPO / POTOK (marketed under the well-established name “Ruchey”). The company also took on support of SURG gas flow metering software – originally developed by RTS-Automatika (formerly part of the RTSoft holding).


          After separating from RTSoft, the engineers renamed their new company “RTS Automatizatsiya” to reflect their broader scope – no longer limited to automation relays and instruments, but now tackling complex challenges combining industrial equipment with software systems at the MES/ERP level, including R&D in liquid and gas flow metering.


          The “RTS” abbreviation has always stood for Real-Time Systems – and still does.


          RTS Automatizatsiya retained close ties with Komens, co-developing advanced solutions in flow metering for complex liquids and remaining a joint stakeholder in the Bakus product group.


          By the late 2010s, the design team behind ALPO/POTOK blending systems became known as AltAqua, which is now well recognized in Russia for its modular and containerized water treatment systems.

          By 2021, blending, water treatment equipment, and software from the
          above companies were already widely deployed in Russia, Belarus,
          Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia.


          In 2022, due to new geopolitical and economic conditions, the group established RTS Technology in Yerevan, Armenia, to transfer part of the logistics and software development outside of Russia and to further develop the water purification business across the region.


          Soon after, our Armenian partners founded John Galt, a sister company with a similar mission – focused exclusively on the European market. Today, John Galt is a key part of our international group.


          In 2023, we partnered with Xi’an Zhongxin Machinery Co. (China), a supplier of industrial equipment across Southeast Asia and Europe. Zhongxin now represents John Galt in China, handles logistics for EU-bound shipments, while John Galt supports Zhongxin’s automation products in the Balkans.


          From 2024, leveraging field experience and cooperation with Balkan companies, John Galt has a permanent presence in Belgrade, along with technical teams capable of working across Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

        - >-
          Open any of Ayn Rand’s legendary novels and you’ll understand. Over
          the years, we’ve come to believe in the ideas presented there. For an
          engineer – or any creator – the key is not to surrender to “looters,”
          but to love the craft and live by honest work, not handouts from the
          authors of “Directive 10-289.”


          We work exclusively with commercial clients, and we live by TANSTAAFL — There Ain’t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch — and thankfully, that’s true.


          If you work the same way, then the answer to “Who is John Galt?” is easy.


          It’s you.
